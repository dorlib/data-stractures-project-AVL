# data-stractures-project-AVL

This is the first programming project in data structures course. </br>
In this project we will implement an ADT of a List while using an AVL tree. </br>

## AVL Node Class

AVL Node class implement a Node in the AVL tree (which is not a search tree). The class preserves </br>
the attribute that the balance factor of each node is between -1 and 1. </br>
For simplicity we decided the add a virtual node as son for each node whice doesn't has a right son,</br>
left son, or both. this class is a helper class for AVLTreeList class and the user wont use this class's function directly. 

### AVLNode functions & time complexity

| Function     | Description                                                                             | Time Complexity | 
|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------|
| getHeight()  | Returns the height field of self.                                                       | O(1)            |
| getValue()   | Returns the value field of self.                                                        | O(1)            |
| getLeft()    | Returns the left child of self. if self is a leaf, his children will be virtual nodes.  | O(1)            |
| getRight()   | Returns the right child of self. if self is a leaf, his children will be virtual nodes. | O(1)            |
| getParent()  | Returns the parent of self. if self is the root, returns None.                          | O(1)            |
| setHeight()  | Sets the height of self.                                                                | O(1)            |
| setValue()   | Sets the value of self.                                                                 | O(1)            |
| setLeft()    | Sets the left child self node without rebalance.                                        | O(1)            | 
| setRight()   | Sets the right child self node without rebalance.                                       | O(1)            |
| setParent()  | Sets the parent of self and update the parent node.                                     | O(1)            |
| isRealNode() | Returns whether self is not a virtual node.                                             | O(1)            |

## AVL Tree List Class

AVL Tree List include the implementation of the list's functionality and the methods that the user will use.
Behind the scenes the list is an AVL Tree which is not a BST but a ranked tree.
The tree itself is implemented using the functions in the AVLNode class.

### AVLTreeList functions & time complexity

| Function      | Description                                                                                                                                | Time Complexity |

| retrieve(i)   | Returns the value of the i'th element in the list if exist, if not, returns None.                                                          | O(log(n))       |

| length()      | Returns the number of elements in the list.                                                                                                | O(1)            |

| concat(lst)   | Concats lst to the end of the list and returns the absulute value of the height difference between the list and lst.                       | O(log(n))       |
| search(vals)  | Returns the first index of the element with the given value in the list or -1 if it doesnt exist.                                          | O(n)            |
